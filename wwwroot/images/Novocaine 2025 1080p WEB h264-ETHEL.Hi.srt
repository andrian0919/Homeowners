What I can do

59
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:06,724
is I can hold on to this
paperwork until after the holiday.

60
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:09,179

for Betty’s Social Security

so I can’t feel pain.

And that’s why I
can’t have the pie.

174
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,738
Or any solid food,
really, because...

175
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:28,176

feel that at all.

00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:43,234
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

182
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:46,498
I have the power
to step on a nail,

183
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:49,414
and not know until my
shoe fills up with, uh...

184
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:51,025
blood.

185
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:54,245
Right. Didn’t think about that.

186
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:56,833
True story, by the way. We were
at the aquarium, my mom fainted.

187
00:09:56,857 --> 00:09:57,945
Jesus.Yeah.

188
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:00,121
My parents, they, um...

189
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:03,254
They basically spent my entire
childhood at the hospital.

190
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:04,604
And then when they found out

191
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:06,127
that the average life expectancy

192
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:09,957
for my condition was, um, 25,

193
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:12,742
they sort of locked me up.

194
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:16,528
I’m sorry.

195
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,444
No, hey, I’m, you know, I’m...

196
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,838
I’m still kicking. [chuckles]

197
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:24,885
Okay. I mean, I
hear all that...

198
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:27,820
but does that really
mean that you can’t have

199
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:29,890
just a little bite of this pie?

200
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:31,979
No. Can’t. I mean...

201
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:34,503
Like I said, I could
bite my tongue off.

202
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:36,548
You’re not gonna bite
your tongue off, Nate.

203
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:39,334
This is the best cherry pie
on the west coast, okay?

204
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:40,683
I swear to God.

205
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,734
Listen. If anything goes
wrong, I’m right here.

206
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:55,915
Okay.

207
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:57,569
Okay?

208
00:10:58,832 --> 00:11:01,312
Here we go. Taking
a bite. Yep.

209
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:03,010
Open your mouth.

210
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:04,533
Okay.

211
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:07,884
Remember, chew softly. Yep.

212
00:11:09,146 --> 00:11:11,453
Uh-huh. Let the magic happen.

213
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:16,850
Uh-huh.

214
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:24,118
My God, that is
so good! [laughs]

215
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,861
That is so good. Oh, my God!

216
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:30,951
Oh, my God! Wha...
Yeah, I told you.

217
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,648
What?

218
00:11:32,822 --> 00:11:35,129
This is pie? This
is pie. Yeah!

219
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:36,826
[laughs] Pie’s good.

220
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,175
Congratulations.

221
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:39,394
Whoa!

222
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:41,135
[exhales]

223
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:44,399
What are you doing
later tonight?

224
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:46,183
[chuckles]

225
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:49,926
[Nate] Look, she invited
me out to this art show.

226
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,233
[stammers] I’m
just not gonna go.

227
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:55,366
I think I’m just gonna stay here
and we’ll play, and it’ll be fine.

228
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,518
[friend] You’ve been talking
about this girl for months.

229
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:58,979
You’re basically
in love with her.

230
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:00,937
If I were you, I’d be
all over that shit!

231
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:02,504
[Nate] But I’m not like you.

232
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:04,593
I’m not cool. I
don’t drive a Harley.

233
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,682
I’m not this hunky
guy with a man bun.

234
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:08,553
[friend sighs] Again,
it’s a short pony.

235
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,808
But dude, that stuff is not
why I do well with women.

236
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:12,993
Does it help? Of course it
does, I’m not gonna lie.

237
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,995
But confidence is king!

238
00:12:16,344 --> 00:12:18,128
I feel like I’m gonna
mess it up somehow.

239
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:20,174
[friend] What’s the
worst that can happen?

240
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:22,588
You wind up alone in your
living room playing video games?

241
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:27,181
You’re already there, my guy!
What do you have to lose?

242
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,883
Nate, you’re gonna die. What?

243
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:35,711
Oh, shit. Sorry. Um...

244
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:37,626
Ah, okay.

245
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,716
[friend] No, no, no, that was
actually really impressive.

246
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,389
I’m sorry, my head’s
not in this right now.

247
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:44,067
Can I call you back
a little later?

248
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:45,479
[friend] Oh, sure, yeah.
I’ll just go fuck myself.

249
00:12:45,503 --> 00:12:47,114
Okay, thanks.

250
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,378
[sighs]

251
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:52,510
["Casual" playing]

252
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:56,863
[chattering]

253
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:31,723
Boo! Hey! Hi.

254
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:34,117
Hey. You came,
you’re here. Yeah!

255
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:37,120
No, of course. You know,
my schedule cleared up

256
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:39,055
and, uh, yeah. Cool. Well,
I’m glad you’re here.

257
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:41,211
Yeah, of course.
What do you think?

258
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:42,822
These are yours? Mm-hmm.

259
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:46,173
These are awesome.
[laughs] Oh, thank you.

260
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:48,479
Who are they?

261
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:50,525
Um, they’re from
my therapy group.

262
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:53,006
Some cutters, some suicidal.

263
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,747
Everyone’s kind of
recovering in their own way.

264
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:58,359
Jesus, you run a
therapy group, too? Huh.

265
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,535
Oh. [chuckles] No,
no, no. I attend it.

266
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,102
Oh. Oh.

267
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,322
Damn, I’m so... I’m sorry.

268
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:08,325
No, no, no. Don’t
apologize. I did not mean...

269
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:09,631
You’re okay, it’s fine. Okay.

270
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:11,024
I’m not ashamed of it. Okay.

271
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:13,548
Oh, wait, you have
a... [Sherry] Oh, God!

272
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:15,506
[laughing]

273
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,030
I sold one. Yeah.

274
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:18,727
Why are you so surprised?

275
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:21,556
Come on.

276
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:23,819
Oh, yeah.

277
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:28,302
Um... So, where’d you grow up?

278
00:14:28,476 --> 00:14:31,653
Well, I grew up in Tucson.

279
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,698
And Cedar City.

280
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:36,049
And Sacramento.

281
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:38,094
Hmm.

282
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:40,096
I was in foster
care. Okay, yeah.

283
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,056
So I just kind of bounced
around until I was twelve

284
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,709
and then I got adopted.

285
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,929
And I had, you know, uh,

286
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:49,801
my own room and a big
brother and parents.

287
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:51,629
And it was all very exciting.

288
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:53,849
That’s amazing! Do you
still see them a lot?

289
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:55,111
[Sherry chuckles]

290
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:56,634
Not really, no.

291
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:58,201
Um...

292
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,812
It wasn’t exactly
a loving household.

293
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:02,509
Okay. Yeah.

294
00:15:02,597 --> 00:15:04,033
Yeah. So, I, uh...

295
00:15:05,382 --> 00:15:06,557
left when I was eighteen,

296
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:08,091
and I’ve been on
my own ever since.

297
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:12,215
Man, that is tough. I’m sorry.

298
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:14,086
It’s fine.

299
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:15,479
You know,

300
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:17,873
if you don’t have
anybody you care about,

301
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:19,353
it’s harder to get hurt, right?

302
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:22,095
[man] Novocaine?

303
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:26,490
Holy shit.

304
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:28,231
It is you!

305
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:30,146
I mean... This
is fucking wild.

306
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,626
I... [splutters]

307
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,933
[laughing] I thought
you’d be dead by now.

308
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,065
Yeah, well...

309
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:38,285
I’m not. Yeah!

310
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:39,895
Good for you, bro.

311
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:42,071
[thump] [laughs]

312
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:44,247
Just like old times, huh?

313
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:45,814
It’s fucking Novocaine!

314
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,598
And he’s not fucking dead!

315
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:48,904
[laughing]

316
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:50,601
[Sherry] So who was that?

317
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:53,387
Oh. Uh, that was, um...

318
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,737
some asshole that I went
to middle school with.

319
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:59,915
And what did he
call you? Novocaine?

320
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,310
Yeah, uh, it was...

321
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:07,140
It was just some dumb
nickname they gave me.

322
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:10,970
You know, once the other kids
found out about my condition,

323
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:14,538
they basically started kicking
my ass pretty much daily,

324
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:16,366
figuring it didn’t
matter, you know,

325
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,152
because I couldn’t
feel any of it, so...

326
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:23,852
I’m sorry.

327
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:27,029
Yeah. But...

328
00:16:28,117 --> 00:16:30,859
I got to say, as far
as nicknames go...

329
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,079
"Novocaine"? [chuckles]

330
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:36,560
Kind of badass. No.

331
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:38,780
Really? Yeah! Yeah.

332
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:41,696
Okay, well, thank you,
but they didn’t think so.

333
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:44,090
It-it... It was
fine. [watch beeps]

334
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,570
[beeping continues]

335
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:49,486
S-Sorry. Um, excuse me for
one second. I’m just gonna...

336
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:52,533
Hey!

337
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:54,100
Yeah?

338
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:56,711
What is the deal with the alarm?

339
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:58,104
Yeah, um...

340
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,257
I got to set one of
these every three hours

341
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:03,239
or else my bladder
might explode.

342
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:08,810
Other kids had a blast with
that one, too. Trust me.

343
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:23,346
[man, Sherry chatting]

344
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:27,872
[laughing, chatting]

345
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,271
[clears throat]

346
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:37,534
You’re so funny. Yeah,
I like to think I am.

347
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,101
World-traveling
kinda guy. Hey.

348
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:41,669
Glad you two are getting along.

349
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:43,888
We really are. He’s hilarious.

350
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:46,761
You know what?

351
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:49,329
I think you two just need
to let bygones be bygones.

352
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:50,852
What do you say?

353
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:54,812
What do you mean? Shots! Duh!

354
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:57,119
Come on. My treat.

355
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:59,774
Yeah, sure, why not?
[Sherry] Nice. Okay, great.

356
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:02,168
Hey, and, uh, no

Yeah, sure.

Yeah, what is that?

Yeah, it’s Novocaine’s favorite.

00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:51,217
Hey, should we, um,
head back to your place?

00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:53,044
You can put those on his tab.

You’re a very good
actor. Oh, thank you.

Oh, my God. That’s
got to be killing him

380

thinking that I’m
taking you home.

381
00:19:07,972 --> 00:19:09,322

What the fuck? Who are you?

408

These are amazing. Where
did you get them done?

Uh...

410
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:54,253
I did them myself.
No, did you really?

411
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:55,950
Yeah. How long
did that take you?

412
00:20:56,124 --> 00:20:57,430
Um...

413
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:59,780
Well, it started when
I was a teenager and...

414
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:01,477
as I got better at it,

415
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:04,393
I kind of got more sucked
into it, and it was, uh...

416
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:07,614
It was just like, um,

This other life that,

420
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:18,102
you know, was
actually an adventure.

00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:20,757
It’s a story, isn’t it?

00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:24,195
Yeah. Yeah, you could...

423
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,241
You could call it that, yeah.

424
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:29,853
How does it end?

425
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:32,769
I don’t know. Um...

426
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:35,381
I’m still figuring that out.

427
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:39,994
So, I have a question.

428
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:45,565
If you can’t feel pain,

429
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:51,397
does that also mean
that you can’t feel...

431
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,103
I mean, uh...

00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:04,366
I think I can.

Okay.

436
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:20,295
How about this?

437
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:29,870
Definitely feeling something.

I’m better than good.
We’re rich, motherfuckers!

582
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,087
It’s not about the money.

583
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:57,393
What is important
is that we had fun.

584
00:32:02,094 --> 00:32:03,878

Wait.

Uh, no, but...

00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:47,982
You ever fired a gun before?

625
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:55,381
Do you, uh... even know
where the safety is? Hmm?

626
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:56,773
Mm-hmm.

Hey, last chance.

You had to do it.
You had to do it.

674
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:02,220
Think about Sherry.

00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:26,068
At work.

00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,942
Hey, what?

682
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,124
Okay, okay.

683
00:37:40,867 --> 00:37:41,867
All right.

[grunting]

686
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:17,251
[friend on phone] I’m sorry,
so Sherry was kidnapped

687
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:18,818
and you killed a
guy in a kitchen?

688
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:20,578
Roscoe, just listen
to me very carefully.

689
00:38:20,602 --> 00:38:22,691
I don’t have a lot of...
Oh, my God, I got shot.

690
00:38:22,865 --> 00:38:24,452
[Roscoe] What, you
got shot? Just listen.

691
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:26,565
I just texted you a
photo of a tattoo.

692
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:28,859
I need you to call around
to every parlor in San Diego

693
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:30,402
and try to find out
who did the art.

694
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:31,807
[Roscoe] What am I,
your fucking secretary?

695
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:33,311
I’m not doing shit!

696
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:35,376
Roscoe, I wouldn’t ask if
I had any other choice.

697
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,520
I mean, we’re a team, right?

698
00:38:36,575 --> 00:38:37,815
[Roscoe] Yes, a
video game team.

699
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:39,447
We’ve never even met in person.

700
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:42,363
And now you’re involving
me in a real-life murder?

701
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:43,862
Why don’t you just
call the police?

702
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:46,193
You know, I technically
stole a cop car.

703
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:48,563
Then there’s the whole thing
about the guy that I killed.

704
00:38:48,587 --> 00:38:50,565
[Roscoe sighs] Fine. Jesus.
I’ll get you the address,

705
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:51,589
but that’s it, okay?

706
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,765
Okay, thank you!

707
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:53,940
Thank you, bye.

710
00:39:09,303 --> 00:39:10,503

any suspicious
activity in their area

712
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:15,048
but to not engage with
possible suspects.

713
00:39:15,222 --> 00:39:17,022
[detective 1] Shit. Bad
week to quit drinking.

714
00:39:18,051 --> 00:39:20,314
You quit drinking?

715
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:22,577
No, no. I just
mean it would be.

716
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:24,492
Detective! Yeah,
what do you got?

717
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:25,786
There’s three officers down.

718
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:27,234
One in the ICU.

00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:29,802
Bank manager DOA inside.

720
00:39:29,976 --> 00:39:31,717
Three gunmen, two cars.

721
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:33,458
They took a hostage with them.

722
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,416
And one additional
suspect at large.

723
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,591
Additional suspect?

724
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:38,680
Yeah, the assistant manager.

725
00:39:38,854 --> 00:39:40,987
He stole a cruiser and
followed the gunmen.

726
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:43,381
Witnesses say it’s the same
guy who opened the vault.

727
00:39:45,078 --> 00:39:46,427
Could be a double-cross.

728
00:39:47,646 --> 00:39:48,821
Do we have units in pursuit?

729
00:39:48,995 --> 00:39:50,779
No, these were the
only ones in the area.

730
00:39:50,953 --> 00:39:52,477
Calls went out to
the Fifth and Sixth,

731
00:39:52,651 --> 00:39:54,827
but they’re spread thin
’cause of the holidays.

732
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:57,046
Okay, thank you,
Officer. Thank you.

733
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:03,139
We need to get a file on that
assistant manager, quick.

734
00:40:03,313 --> 00:40:04,753
Today was supposed
to be an easy one.

735
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,840
I’m going.Thanks.

736
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:09,971
I’m going.

737
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:12,714
Coming through,
newsies! Out of my way!

738
00:40:12,888 --> 00:40:13,889
Come on.

739
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:49,403
[knocking on door]

740
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:52,145
Closed for lunch!
Come back later!

741
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,060
[knocking continues]

742
00:40:54,234 --> 00:40:55,278
Hmm.

743
00:40:57,803 --> 00:41:00,022
Hey! It’s me! Nate!

744
00:41:00,196 --> 00:41:01,676
[whispering] What
in the Sam Hill?

745
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,809
[Nate] From the bank.
Could you let me in?

746
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:06,464
Hi.

747
00:41:12,121 --> 00:41:14,361
You sure you don’t want me to
just call you an ambulance?

748
00:41:14,428 --> 00:41:15,951
Uh, no. I told you.
There’s no time.

749
00:41:17,257 --> 00:41:18,257
[sighing] All right.

750
00:41:18,345 --> 00:41:19,738
[Earl groaning]

751
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:20,956
Sweet Jesus!

752
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,436
Here we go.

753
00:41:27,572 --> 00:41:30,966
Earl, you okay? Me?
Oh, yeah, just...

754
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,752
This was not what
I expected today.

755
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:35,754
Hey, if it’s any
consolation, me neither.

756
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:38,191
All right.

757
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:40,019
All right.

758
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,151
If I can find it.

759
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,806
[flesh squelching]

760
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,113
Huh. Is that it?

761
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:51,596
Hey! There we go. Ah!

762
00:41:53,423 --> 00:41:54,903
All right.

763
00:41:57,689 --> 00:41:58,907
Just some of this.

764
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:00,996
Just a little bit.

765
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:04,130
Okay. [sniffles]

766
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:05,827
Here we go.

767
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:07,742
[Earl wincing]

768
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:09,614
Yeah. There we go, see?

769
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:12,530
Good as new. [sighing]

770
00:42:12,704 --> 00:42:15,271
Oh, whoa. Um...

771
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:16,969
Earl, was there...

772
00:42:17,143 --> 00:42:18,860
[stammers] There’s an
EpiPen in there, right?

773
00:42:18,884 --> 00:42:20,233
You mind handing that to me?

774
00:42:21,147 --> 00:42:22,931
What? You allergic
to something?

775
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:24,542
Um, thank you, no, uh...

776
00:42:24,716 --> 00:42:26,587
epinephrine’s just another
form of adrenaline.

777
00:42:26,761 --> 00:42:29,851
It should, uh, keep
me from passing out.

778
00:42:30,635 --> 00:42:32,158
[gasps sharply]

779
00:42:36,162 --> 00:42:37,206
Yeah, that did it.

780
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:39,165
Okay.

781
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:41,559
[sighs loudly]

782
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:44,170
Yeah, all right. Hey, Earl.

783
00:42:44,344 --> 00:42:45,911
Thank you so much.
Sorry, this was...

784
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,564
a lot.

785
00:42:47,652 --> 00:42:49,567
You go get that girl, Nate.

786
00:42:53,005 --> 00:42:54,441
Oh, hey, um...

787
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:59,228
Almost forgot. This should help
with the mortgage for a while.

788
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:01,056
[Earl gasps]

789
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:04,059
Betty always said
you were a good kid.

790
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:10,065
Oh! Sorry.

791
00:43:11,414 --> 00:43:13,765
All right, uh,
I’ll see you later.

792
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:15,505
You know, if I...
If I don’t, uh, die.

793
00:43:21,903 --> 00:43:23,513
[sighs, chuckles]

794
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:27,648
You might want to
launder that, by the way.

795
00:43:28,562 --> 00:43:29,607
Ah.

796
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:38,267
[phone chimes]

797
00:44:00,899 --> 00:44:02,944
[sighs]

798
00:44:07,862 --> 00:44:09,274
[detective 2] One
of our bank robbers?

799
00:44:09,298 --> 00:44:11,039
God, I hope so.

800
00:44:11,213 --> 00:44:13,563
Be a shame if it
was the real Santa.

801
00:44:13,738 --> 00:44:18,177
Kitchen staff said a crazy
guy in a tie did all this.

802
00:44:19,265 --> 00:44:21,310
I’m thinking that’s
our assistant manager.

803
00:44:22,137 --> 00:44:23,312
Oh, speaking of...

804
00:44:23,486 --> 00:44:24,531
[grunts]

805
00:44:25,924 --> 00:44:27,621
Got a bit of a profile on him.

806
00:44:30,537 --> 00:44:32,017
Uh, Nathan Caine.

807
00:44:32,191 --> 00:44:34,062
Single. Male. Thirty.

808
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:36,151
No record. No affiliations.

809
00:44:36,325 --> 00:44:38,284
Zero traffic tickets.

810
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:42,070
An online gamer tag
of "Magicnateball."

811
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:44,682
Oh, that’s good. Uh...

812
00:44:44,856 --> 00:44:48,076
Worked at San Diego
Trust for six years.

813
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,775
That just doesn’t sound like
a stone-cold killer to me.

814
00:44:51,514 --> 00:44:52,864
And yet...

815
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:55,823
Yeah.

816
00:44:56,911 --> 00:44:58,783
Do you have a cell
phone number for him?

817
00:44:58,957 --> 00:45:01,699
Guy just robbed a
bank, killed a guy.

818
00:45:01,873 --> 00:45:03,851
Do you really think he’s just
picking up his cell phone?

819
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:05,703
[phone ringing]

820
00:45:05,877 --> 00:45:08,140
This is Nate speaking.
[on phone] Hi, Nate.

821
00:45:08,314 --> 00:45:10,272
Uh, this is Detective
Barbara Mincy

822
00:45:10,446 --> 00:45:12,187
of the San Diego Police.

823
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:13,580
How you doing?

824
00:45:13,754 --> 00:45:15,034
[Nate] I’ve... I’ve been better.

825
00:45:15,103 --> 00:45:16,452
Did you catch the others?

826
00:45:16,626 --> 00:45:18,672
Is Sherry, the
hostage, is she safe?

827
00:45:18,846 --> 00:45:20,805
Yeah, well, you know,
we’re working on that.

828
00:45:20,979 --> 00:45:23,261
But whatever it is you’re doing
isn’t making our job easier.

829
00:45:23,285 --> 00:45:25,679
So if you could turn yourself
and the cash in right now...

830
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:27,420
Whoa, wait, wait, sorry. Um...

831
00:45:29,944 --> 00:45:31,859
Holy shit. You think
I’m in on this.

832
00:45:32,033 --> 00:45:34,359
[Mincy] No, no, Nate, uh, we’re
just following the facts here.

833
00:45:34,383 --> 00:45:37,386
Look, hey, I don’t give a shit about
the money. I just want to save Sherry.

834
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,825
Mm-hmm. Well, that’s our job
to worry about, not yours.

835
00:45:40,999 --> 00:45:43,305
Yeah, well, I heard that
75% of hostages who die

836
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:45,394
are killed in the first
three hours, so...

837
00:45:45,568 --> 00:45:47,285
Unless you’re calling me
to tell me you found her,

838
00:45:47,309 --> 00:45:48,528
I’m not gonna stop.

839
00:45:49,355 --> 00:45:50,356
This Sherry...

840
00:45:51,444 --> 00:45:53,446
She, uh, she your girlfriend?

841
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,665
Yeah, I mean, you know,
we haven’t necessarily

842
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,711
put a label on anything
yet, but the...

843
00:45:57,885 --> 00:45:59,689
Stop it, all right? I know
what you’re trying to do.

844
00:45:59,713 --> 00:46:00,953
You don’t give a shit about us.

845
00:46:01,062 --> 00:46:02,368
No, Nate, that’s not true.

846
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:04,979
We just want everyone
to get home safe, okay?

847
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:06,348
I understand you care
about her, but...

848
00:46:06,372 --> 00:46:07,416
Do you?

849
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,639
Do you know what it’s like to wait
your whole life to meet someone?

850
00:46:14,206 --> 00:46:15,947
Someone who changes
everything? Who...

851
00:46:17,513 --> 00:46:19,341
finally gives your life meaning?

852
00:46:21,604 --> 00:46:23,911
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

853
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:26,784
My daughter.

854
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:32,485
And if your daughter
was kidnapped,

855
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:34,748
would you wait around for
someone else to save her?

856
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:37,316
Or would you do it yourself?

857
00:46:45,324 --> 00:46:47,543
All right, Nate.
Have it your way.

858
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:56,944
[sighs]

859
00:46:57,902 --> 00:46:59,381
Got a trace on his cell.

860
00:47:04,212 --> 00:47:05,344
Hey, you good?

861
00:47:05,997 --> 00:47:07,302
Yeah. Let’s move.

862
00:47:10,784 --> 00:47:16,094
[dispatcher on scanner] 11898, I
show your dispatch and send 29C-47.

863
00:47:16,268 --> 00:47:19,140
This is a total
fucking shit show, man.

864
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:22,100
Look, there’s nothing on the
scanner about your brother.

865
00:47:22,274 --> 00:47:24,058
That means he probably
lost the tail.

866
00:47:24,232 --> 00:47:25,930
Then why the fuck ain’t he here?

867
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:28,454
[chuckles] I don’t know!

868
00:47:28,628 --> 00:47:30,748
Okay? I don’t know. I’m sorry.
I don’t know everything.

869
00:47:32,284 --> 00:47:35,200
Maybe he had to switch vehicles.

870
00:47:35,374 --> 00:47:37,898
Maybe he stopped off
to get some ice cream.

871
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:40,509
The point is, your
fucking whining about it

872
00:47:40,683 --> 00:47:42,860
isn’t gonna make him
show up any faster.

873
00:47:45,601 --> 00:47:47,299
Watch how you’re talking to me.

874
00:47:47,473 --> 00:47:48,667
You may be running
point on this,

875
00:47:48,691 --> 00:47:50,171
but you’re not my fucking boss.

876
00:47:51,129 --> 00:47:52,130
Hmm.

877
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:54,219
Andre...

878
00:47:54,393 --> 00:47:56,917
I need you to switch
up the vibe right now.

879
00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:01,966
Because you’re bumming me out.

880
00:48:03,054 --> 00:48:04,403
Come on.

881
00:48:04,577 --> 00:48:06,144
Ben is gonna be
back in 15 minutes

882
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:08,407
and everything is gonna be fine.

883
00:48:08,581 --> 00:48:11,801
Just keep saying it.
"Everything is gonna be fine."

884
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:13,238
[Sherry] Yeah, fucking right.

885
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:20,723
[clears throat]

886
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,379
No more silent treatment, huh?

887
00:48:30,168 --> 00:48:31,169
Hey.

888
00:48:32,692 --> 00:48:34,215
I’m sorry I hit you, okay?

889
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:38,524
Do you, um...

890
00:48:40,482 --> 00:48:41,483
Do you want to hit me?

891
00:48:41,657 --> 00:48:43,355
Make it even?

892
00:48:44,356 --> 00:48:45,574
Fuck you.

893
00:48:46,488 --> 00:48:47,533
Wow.

894
00:48:48,055 --> 00:48:49,752
[scoffs]

895
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,406
I do not like that tone.

896
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,018
I don’t like it.

897
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:58,936
But I got just the thing
to fix that attitude.

898
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:14,952
Oh, come on!

899
00:49:15,126 --> 00:49:17,041
You love cola gummies.
Stop it, Simon!

900
00:49:17,737 --> 00:49:18,737
Stop.

901
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:20,000
[Simon] What is this?

902
00:49:20,174 --> 00:49:22,568
Who is this little tantrum for?

903
00:49:23,525 --> 00:49:25,005
[Simon scoffs]

904
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:27,573
We’re alone now.

905
00:49:27,747 --> 00:49:30,445
You can feel free to break
character whenever you’d like, sis.

906
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:32,336
It’s just that you promised
nobody would get hurt, okay?

907
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,492
You fucking promised.

908
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:34,928
It’s the heat of battle, Sher.

909
00:49:35,102 --> 00:49:36,582
Shit happens. The
heat of battle?

910
00:49:36,756 --> 00:49:37,907
You did not have to kill Nigel!

911
00:49:37,931 --> 00:49:40,629
Nigel? Who is Nigel?

912
00:49:40,803 --> 00:49:42,196
The bank manager.

913
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:44,459
[Simon scoffs] He was
a nice fucking guy.

914
00:49:44,633 --> 00:49:46,200
He was a Nigel too, wasn’t he?

915
00:49:46,374 --> 00:49:48,115
[laughs] Nigel.

916
00:49:51,466 --> 00:49:52,815
Sher.

917
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,035
I hate to break this to you,

918
00:49:55,209 --> 00:49:57,951
but if you were able to get that
vault code out of lover boy,

919
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:00,103
everyone would be alive
right now, including Nigel.

920
00:50:00,127 --> 00:50:01,999
Oh, my God. [Simon] Hmm.

921
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,654
It’s not like he had
it framed on his wall.

922
00:50:07,874 --> 00:50:09,571
Sounds a whole lot
like an excuse.

923
00:50:09,745 --> 00:50:10,790
[chuckles]

924
00:50:12,183 --> 00:50:13,619
You know how I
feel about excuses.

925
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:15,360
Don’t you?

926
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:19,755
You’re so fucking impossible.

927
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,845
What’s done is done. Okay?

928
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,935
Let’s just stay
focused on the plan,

929
00:50:26,936 --> 00:50:28,256
and we can hash
all this out later

930
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:30,201
over some piña
coladas in Mexico.

931
00:50:31,506 --> 00:50:32,899
Those are disgusting,
by the way.

932
00:50:34,422 --> 00:50:36,685
[Simon] Ugh! Gets
in your teeth.

933
00:50:38,296 --> 00:50:39,645
[opera music playing]

934
00:50:39,819 --> 00:50:41,516
[footsteps approaching]

935
00:50:42,213 --> 00:50:43,692
[sighs]

936
00:50:53,876 --> 00:50:54,921
[gasps]

937
00:50:55,878 --> 00:50:57,924
Yeah? Hello, ma’am.

938
00:50:58,098 --> 00:51:01,188
Um, is Zeno here?

939
00:51:01,362 --> 00:51:02,962
I just need to talk
with him for a second.

940
00:51:03,103 --> 00:51:04,626
Sorry, customers only.

941
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,889
You know what? That’s
actually why I’m here.

942
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,719
Um, I’m just looking
to get some work done.

943
00:51:12,286 --> 00:51:13,592
[clears throat]

944
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,050
Looks like you’ve already
had some work done today.

945
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,118
Sorry?

946
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:20,686
Oh! My appearance.

947
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:21,904
Uh, well,

948
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:24,777
you should see the other guy.

949
00:51:29,347 --> 00:51:30,565
[sighs]

950
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,480
[door unlocks]

951
00:51:33,612 --> 00:51:35,179
[opera music continues]

952
00:51:36,745 --> 00:51:37,790
Thank you.

953
00:51:40,532 --> 00:51:41,837
Oh.

954
00:51:42,011 --> 00:51:43,926
Thought that was a
real guy for a second.

955
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,804
Wait here. Thank you.

956
00:52:03,859 --> 00:52:05,165
[breathes heavily]

957
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:06,775
[footsteps approaching]

958
00:52:08,821 --> 00:52:10,214
[Zeno] You. What’s good?

959
00:52:12,085 --> 00:52:13,217
I’m good. I’m...

960
00:52:13,391 --> 00:52:14,957
Everything’s good. Um...

961
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,743
Uh, I was just looking
to get a tattoo.

962
00:52:17,917 --> 00:52:20,963
Fuck. What’s happening
with your hand?

963
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,139
Oh!

964
00:52:24,053 --> 00:52:25,490
Psoriasis.

965
00:52:25,664 --> 00:52:27,405
It’s really, really
flared up on me today.

966
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:29,102
Yeah, all right.

967
00:52:29,276 --> 00:52:30,799
[sighs] So where we working?

968
00:52:30,973 --> 00:52:32,975
Uh, yeah, just, um...

969
00:52:34,499 --> 00:52:36,065
right here.

970
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,590
Damn. I like your
tats. That’s good shit.

971
00:52:38,764 --> 00:52:40,418
Oh. Wow, thank you so much.

972
00:52:40,592 --> 00:52:43,160
I, uh, I like yours, too.

973
00:52:43,899 --> 00:52:46,032
So, uh, what you want?

974
00:52:46,206 --> 00:52:48,904
Well, I have a
buddy of mine, um,

975
00:52:49,078 --> 00:52:51,429
and he got this awesome tattoo.
I want the exact same one.

976
00:52:51,603 --> 00:52:54,475
I think he said
that he got it here?

977
00:52:54,649 --> 00:52:56,042
[Zeno] No shit.

978
00:52:56,216 --> 00:52:58,262
[chuckles] You know Ben? Ben!

979
00:52:59,306 --> 00:53:00,829
Yeah.Ben.

980
00:53:01,874 --> 00:53:04,572
So, um, did you
guys serve together?

981
00:53:04,746 --> 00:53:06,052
Yeah, we did.

982
00:53:06,226 --> 00:53:07,880
Serve together.

983
00:53:08,054 --> 00:53:10,012
Honorably. Hmm.

984
00:53:10,752 --> 00:53:12,101
Rock on, brother.

985
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:17,063
Hey, um, speaking of Ben,

986
00:53:17,237 --> 00:53:19,457
is he still working
at the same place?

987
00:53:19,631 --> 00:53:21,937
I don’t know. Ben
doesn’t talk about work.

988
00:53:22,111 --> 00:53:23,896
[Nate] Classic Ben. Hates work.

989
00:53:24,462 --> 00:53:25,463
Hates it.

990
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:27,291
Um...

991
00:53:27,465 --> 00:53:29,510
Funny story about Ben.

992
00:53:29,684 --> 00:53:31,295
Um, you know his
last name, right?

993
00:53:31,469 --> 00:53:32,513
Yeah.

994
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:34,341
Okay.

995
00:53:34,515 --> 00:53:36,125
How would you think
it’s pronounced?

996
00:53:43,394 --> 00:53:46,353
Seriously, you’re gonna...
you’re gonna love this.

997
00:53:46,527 --> 00:53:48,573
Just... just say his last name.

998
00:53:53,447 --> 00:53:54,796
Why don’t you say it?

999
00:54:00,106 --> 00:54:01,325
Ah, you know, never mind.

1000
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,372
It’s fine. It’s
not that funny.

1001
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:07,132
Because, you know, if
you tell a bad joke,

1002
00:54:07,156 --> 00:54:08,810
you have to explain
it, it’s not good.

1003
00:54:08,984 --> 00:54:10,247
Yeah, give me a sec.

1004
00:54:10,421 --> 00:54:12,292
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Take your time.

1005
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,383
[sighs deeply]

1006
00:54:18,994 --> 00:54:20,474
[Zeno] You know,

1007
00:54:20,648 --> 00:54:22,694
I’m thinking that maybe
you don’t know Ben.

1008
00:54:22,868 --> 00:54:23,912
[gun cocks]

1009
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,828
Yo, what the fuck is this?

1010
00:54:27,002 --> 00:54:29,122
I’m not gonna hurt you, okay?
Just put down the knife.

1011
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:32,878
[knife clangs]

1012
00:54:33,052 --> 00:54:35,184
Tell me everything you know
about Ben and I’m gone.

1013
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:36,447
[grunts] [Nate] Whoa!

1014
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:39,841
Shit! Oh, no!

1015
00:54:44,542 --> 00:54:46,239
[screams] [grunts]

1016
00:54:51,592 --> 00:54:53,290
I’ll give you
another one for free.

1017
00:54:53,464 --> 00:54:54,856
[both grunting]

1018
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:57,511
[chuckles] Let me show
you how it’s done.

1019
00:55:00,645 --> 00:55:02,299
[Nate panting]

1020
00:55:03,038 --> 00:55:05,780
[screams]

1021
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:08,957
[both scream]

1022
00:55:09,131 --> 00:55:10,916
Shit. Fuck. Oh...

1023
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:12,787
[grunting] [panting]

1024
00:55:14,006 --> 00:55:16,225
Fuck! Ow! Shit.

1025
00:55:16,835 --> 00:55:18,358
You little shit!

1026
00:55:18,532 --> 00:55:20,012
Fuck you, man.

1027
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:24,712
[both grunting]

1028
00:55:29,238 --> 00:55:30,762
Enough of this shit.

1029
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,519
[panting]

1030
00:55:48,693 --> 00:55:50,434
[Zeno chuckling]

1031
00:56:03,534 --> 00:56:05,362
What the fuck are you doing?

1032
00:56:08,626 --> 00:56:10,454
[panting, groaning]

1033
00:56:22,248 --> 00:56:23,292
Oh! [grunting]

1034
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:25,164
[screams] Fuck!

1035
00:56:35,696 --> 00:56:36,958
[screaming]

1036
00:56:37,132 --> 00:56:38,786
Shit! Fuck! My eyes!

1037
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,005
Oh, fuck!

1038
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:42,137
[groaning] Oh, fuck!

1039
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:45,314
I can’t see! Okay.
All right, man.

1040
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:47,665
[groans] What the
fuck? What’s his name?

1041
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,015
Fuck you and the horse
you rode in on, man.

1042
00:56:53,279 --> 00:56:54,585
Okay. Look, look.

1043
00:56:54,759 --> 00:56:57,326
Please. Please don’t
make me do this.

1044
00:56:57,501 --> 00:56:59,546
Fucking eat shit, man.

1045
00:57:00,765 --> 00:57:03,332
Okay. Okay, this is
gonna suck. Are you sure?

1046
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:04,856
Oh, fuck off!

1047
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:06,379
Okay. Here we go.

1048
00:57:06,553 --> 00:57:08,555
[screams] Fuck!

1049
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:10,296
Hey, hey, just give me his name.

1050
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:12,429
Just give me his
name. [screams]

1051
00:57:12,603 --> 00:57:14,169
Oh, Jesus!

1052
00:57:14,343 --> 00:57:16,389
Fuck, it’s Clark! It’s
Clark! Okay. Okay.

1053
00:57:16,563 --> 00:57:18,652
Clark, Ben. Ben Clark.

1054
00:57:19,827 --> 00:57:21,394
There we go. Was that so hard?

1055
00:57:23,091 --> 00:57:24,702
Listen, I’ve given
you what you want.

1056
00:57:24,876 --> 00:57:26,355
[stammering] Now
just fucking go.

1057
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:27,748
Just one second. One second.

1058
00:57:27,922 --> 00:57:30,708
[line ringing] [Zeno
groans] Oh, shit.

1059
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:33,145
Hey there, Chad, it’s Nate
over at San Diego Trust.

1060
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:35,713
Glad I caught you
before the holiday.

1061
00:57:35,887 --> 00:57:38,542
Yeah, listen, I was hoping you
could run a quick credit check

1062
00:57:38,716 --> 00:57:40,413
on a new client whose
file’s incomplete.

1063
00:57:40,587 --> 00:57:42,197
His name is Ben
Clark. [groaning]

1064
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:44,852
He did serve in the military.
Does that narrow it down?

1065
00:57:46,593 --> 00:57:49,030
Yeah. Yeah, V.A.
loans. That’s him.

1066
00:57:49,204 --> 00:57:52,425
Um, you don’t have any
employment on record, do you?

1067
00:57:53,644 --> 00:57:55,036
How about a
last-known residence?

1068
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,693
Yeah, um, yeah, hold
on one second. Um...

1069
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:05,177
Okay, shoot.

1070
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,658
Okay.

1071
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:11,052
402...

1072
00:58:13,011 --> 00:58:16,057
North Tower Lane.

1073
00:58:16,231 --> 00:58:19,408
All right. Chad, thank
you so much, man.

1074
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:20,627
You’re the best.

1075
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,629
Oh.

1076
00:58:22,803 --> 00:58:25,589
Yeah, Merry Christmas
to you, too. Go, Padres.

1077
00:58:39,733 --> 00:58:40,865
[door slams]

1078

[water running]
[exhales deeply]

1079
00:58:52,006 --> 00:58:53,007
[sighs]

1080
00:59:07,935 --> 00:59:10,459
[Andre] Something’s wrong.
He should definitely be here.

1081
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:13,090
Look, he’s got plenty of time. We
can’t leave till it’s dark anyway.

1082
00:59:13,114 --> 00:59:15,005
I’m gonna check his house.
The house he just spent

1083
00:59:15,029 --> 00:59:17,379
all weekend booby-trapping like
he’s Wile E. fucking Coyote?

1084
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,730
That house? You think
he’s gonna go back there?

1085
00:59:19,904 --> 00:59:20,904
Use your brain, man.

1086
00:59:20,992 --> 00:59:22,123
He’s my brother!

1087
00:59:22,297 --> 00:59:23,560
I’m well aware of that.

1088
00:59:23,734 --> 00:59:25,134
Take a half hour.
If he’s not there,

1089
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:26,563
I’ll come back and we can go.

1090
00:59:27,912 --> 00:59:28,913
Andre.

1091
00:59:30,044 --> 00:59:31,263
Andre!

1092
00:59:31,437 --> 00:59:33,308
Don’t be a fucking idiot!

1093
00:59:37,269 --> 00:59:38,531
[sighs]

1094
00:59:47,453 --> 00:59:48,497
[dog barks nearby]

1095
01:00:29,364 --> 01:00:30,496
All right.

1096
01:00:37,459 --> 01:00:40,637
Okay, so you’re a prepper.

1097
01:00:41,376 --> 01:00:42,508
Ew.

1098
01:00:45,946 --> 01:00:47,731
Where the hell do you work?

1099
01:00:47,905 --> 01:00:49,646
[mechanism clicks]
[chain rattles]

1100
01:00:54,868 --> 01:00:55,869
What?

1101
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,002
What is that?

1102
01:01:02,876 --> 01:01:04,008
What the fuck is that?

1103
01:01:05,313 --> 01:01:06,619
Why?

1104
01:01:09,143 --> 01:01:10,754
Okay, uh...

1105
01:01:12,843 --> 01:01:13,974
[groans]

1106
01:01:15,933 --> 01:01:16,934
All right.

1107
01:01:18,413 --> 01:01:19,676
[groans]

1108
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:22,156

[skin tearing]

1110
01:01:23,462 --> 01:01:25,377
[groans] Whoa. Hmm.

1111
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:33,864
No.

1112
01:01:48,356 --> 01:01:49,531
There you are.

1113
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,185
[mechanism clicks]

1114
01:01:51,925 --> 01:01:53,013
Oh.

1115
01:01:53,927 --> 01:01:55,537
Come on! Really?

1116
01:01:57,365 --> 01:01:58,584
[groans]

1117
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,982
Crossbow under the sink.

1118
01:02:06,157 --> 01:02:07,245
Of course.

1119
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:19,083
All right, whatever... Fuck it.

1120
01:02:19,257 --> 01:02:20,998
[grunting]

1121
01:02:59,558 --> 01:03:01,952
Okay. Okay.

1122
01:03:10,699 --> 01:03:12,092
Yes. Yes!

1123
01:03:14,616 --> 01:03:15,661
Yes.

1124
01:03:18,055 --> 01:03:20,405
Okay. I found you.

1125
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:22,755
And now I’m gonna make
you wish you never...

1126
01:03:22,929 --> 01:03:24,409
Oh, my God!

1127
01:03:25,062 --> 01:03:26,280
[grunting]

1128
01:03:26,454 --> 01:03:27,499
What?

1129
01:03:33,244 --> 01:03:34,723
What the fuck?

1130
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:38,815
Oh, fu...

1131
01:03:45,647 --> 01:03:48,172
Oh, phew. Big phew.

1132
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:50,609
Okay. Um...

1133
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:53,525
[phone ringing]
[breathing heavily]

1134
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,840
[Roscoe] This better be you
calling from a hospital or a jail.

1135
01:03:57,877 --> 01:04:00,227
No, not quite. I’m at, uh,

1136
01:04:00,401 --> 01:04:02,621
402 North Tower
Lane in Cortez Hill.

1137
01:04:02,795 --> 01:04:04,904
I’m hanging upside-down and
I need you to come get me.

1138
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:07,008
What the hell do you mean
you’re hanging upside-down?

1139
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,671
I mean I’m currently suspended
in some kind of snare trap,

1140
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,726
and if you don’t come
right now and cut me down,

1141
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,806
then Sherry’s gonna die.
I’m probably gonna die.

1142
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:15,380
Dude, you can’t put
that shit on me.

1143
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:16,698
I’m not getting
involved in this.

1144
01:04:16,722 --> 01:04:18,506
You already are, okay?

1145
01:04:19,638 --> 01:04:21,640
Look, man, I’m sorry. I just...

1146
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:26,906
I don’t know who else to call.

1147
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:30,605
Maybe to you I’m just some random
guy you met on the Internet,

1148
01:04:30,779 --> 01:04:33,454
but to me, all that time we spent
together it actually meant something.

1149
01:04:33,478 --> 01:04:34,740
You’re...

1150
01:04:36,568 --> 01:04:39,092
You’re my only friend, Roscoe.

1151
01:04:39,266 --> 01:04:40,441
And right now,

1152
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:43,053
I need you.

1153
01:04:43,227 --> 01:04:45,185
[Roscoe sighs] Oh, goddamn it!

1154
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:46,970
Okay, look, it says
fifteen minutes,

1155
01:04:47,144 --> 01:04:49,078
but I’ll take the Harley and
be there in ten, all right?

1156
01:04:49,102 --> 01:04:51,496
Yes! Yes, thank you.
Thank you so much.

1157
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:53,230
[Roscoe] Yeah, yeah,
just hang in there.

1158
01:04:53,324 --> 01:04:55,543
Sorry, that wasn’t a pun.
I meant it sincerely.

1159
01:04:55,717 --> 01:04:57,415
No, no, it was
funny. It was funny.

1160
01:04:57,589 --> 01:04:58,851
Just please hurry, okay?

1161
01:04:59,025 --> 01:05:00,026
[Roscoe] Yeah, okay. Bye.

1162
01:05:00,635 --> 01:05:02,246
Okay. Okay.

1163
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:03,987
Okay, ten minutes.

1164
01:05:04,509 --> 01:05:05,553
Ten minutes.

1165
01:05:06,467 --> 01:05:07,707
I can make it ten
minutes. Okay.

1166
01:05:07,773 --> 01:05:09,427
[front door opens]

1167
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:10,601
[Andre] Ben?

1168
01:05:10,689 --> 01:05:12,560
Oh, no.

1169
01:05:14,562 --> 01:05:15,912
You here, bro?

1170
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:46,943
Hi.

1171
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:50,337
Who the hell are you?

1172
01:05:50,511 --> 01:05:52,426
Uh. I’m... I’m just a thief.

1173
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,733
You know, just
came here to, uh...

1174
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,215
thieve.

1175
01:05:59,477 --> 01:06:00,477
Where’s my brother?

1176
01:06:00,565 --> 01:06:02,654
I’m sorry, your what?

1177
01:06:02,828 --> 01:06:04,873
Uh, look, man, look,
I don’t know anything

1178
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:06,658
about anybody’s brother. I’m...

1179
01:06:06,832 --> 01:06:10,096
You know, I just randomly
picked this place and, uh,

1180
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:12,751
well, apparently,
I picked wrong.

1181
01:06:12,925 --> 01:06:14,445
You know, most people
have the doorbell

1182
01:06:14,492 --> 01:06:16,668
with the camera, but
an indoor snare trap?

1183
01:06:16,842 --> 01:06:18,844
[chuckles] Egg on my face.

1184
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:21,412
You don’t look like a thief.

1185
01:06:21,586 --> 01:06:22,717
Yeah, well,

1186
01:06:24,023 --> 01:06:25,938
the best of us rarely do. Hmm.

1187
01:06:28,941 --> 01:06:30,987
So you just picked this
place at random, huh?

1188
01:06:31,161 --> 01:06:33,293
Yeah. Yeah, just
my luck. Yeah?

1189
01:06:33,467 --> 01:06:34,947
Then why the fuck

1190
01:06:36,209 --> 01:06:39,169
do you have his address
on your fucking hand?

1191
01:06:42,607 --> 01:06:44,130
That’s such a good question.

1192
01:06:44,913 --> 01:06:46,306
And... [phone buzzes]

1193
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,200
...the answer’s really
gonna blow your mind.

1194
01:06:49,614 --> 01:06:52,138
Yeah, you can go ahead and
take that if you need to.

1195
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,401
Yeah?

1196
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:57,013
Look, um...

1197
01:06:59,363 --> 01:07:00,363
Ben’s dead.

1198
01:07:01,539 --> 01:07:03,367
Just heard it over the scanner.

1199
01:07:06,457 --> 01:07:09,155
Who did it? Cops? Uh, no.

1200
01:07:09,329 --> 01:07:11,592
Apparently, it was just
some random Good Samaritan.

1201
01:07:12,811 --> 01:07:14,160
Skinny guy in a suit.

1202
01:07:15,988 --> 01:07:17,120
Look, um,

1203
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:19,401
why don’t you just get back here

1204
01:07:19,557 --> 01:07:20,688
and we’ll figure it all out?

1205
01:07:20,862 --> 01:07:21,863
[hangs up]

1206
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:25,128
Did he seriously
just hang up on me?

1207
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,397
[cocks gun]

1208
01:07:37,314 --> 01:07:38,967
Whoa, whoa, hey, hold on.

1209
01:07:39,142 --> 01:07:40,684
Hold on. Hey. Let’s
just talk about this.

1210
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:41,883
You killed my brother!

1211
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,494
Look, man, I, uh...

1212
01:07:46,671 --> 01:07:48,803
I did kill him.

1213
01:07:48,977 --> 01:07:51,086
And, look, I know that means
you’re gonna kill me, too,

1214
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:53,547
but please just do me
a favor, okay? Just...

1215
01:07:54,331 --> 01:07:55,593
Just make it quick.

1216
01:07:55,767 --> 01:07:58,422
There’s no need
to draw this out.

1217
01:08:02,991 --> 01:08:04,689
I got a better idea.

1218
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:08,432
[whispers] Yes!

1219
01:08:08,606 --> 01:08:11,435
[Andre] You know, when
I used to do this shit

1220
01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:13,741
back in special forces...
[DJ indistinct on radio]

1221
01:08:13,915 --> 01:08:15,352
[Nate] Mmm.

1222
01:08:15,526 --> 01:08:18,006
...it was always to try
and get some information.

1223
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:19,356
Mm-hmm.

1224
01:08:20,618 --> 01:08:22,446
But all that matters now...

1225
01:08:23,055 --> 01:08:24,143
is the pain.

1226
01:08:25,188 --> 01:08:27,363
Think about that.
You understand pain?

1227
01:08:27,537 --> 01:08:29,366
Yeah... I hate it so much.

1228
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:31,977
["You’re the Inspiration"
playing on radio]

1229
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:35,546
Oh. Oh! No! Stop it!

1230
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,938
[Andre grunts] [Nate groans]

1231
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,332
I mean, oh, fuck!

1232
01:08:39,506 --> 01:08:41,856

Oh, God, you sadistic fuck.

Oh. [groans]

1239
01:08:59,917 --> 01:09:01,876
No, not the pliers.

1240
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:03,791
Please, not the pliers.

1241
01:09:03,965 --> 01:09:06,142
I can’t even imagine what
you’re gonna do with that.

1242
01:09:06,316 --> 01:09:08,578
[shushes] Please. Oh!

1243
01:09:08,752 --> 01:09:10,145

so much time on this.

That one hurt the most.

1255
01:09:34,822 --> 01:09:36,127
[Nate groans] How you doing?

1256
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:37,911
Terribly.

1257
01:09:37,999 --> 01:09:40,611
No! Please, no.

1258
01:09:41,394 --> 01:09:43,048
Whoa, all this sucks so bad.

1259
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:44,571
Please don’t do that again.

1260
01:09:45,877 --> 01:09:47,531
[Nate exhales sharply]
[phone buzzes]

1261
01:09:48,488 --> 01:09:50,621
[music stops] What?

1262
01:09:50,795 --> 01:09:52,642
[Simon on phone] Where the
hell are you? We’re leaving

1263
01:09:52,666 --> 01:09:54,121
in thirty minutes. Get
your ass back here.

1264
01:09:54,145 --> 01:09:56,496
Yeah, yeah. I will wrap it up.

1265
01:09:58,324 --> 01:09:59,760
[phone clatters on table]

1266
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:03,938
Now for my favorite part.

1267
01:10:08,856 --> 01:10:13,165
I’m gonna keep your eyes
in a jar on my mantel.

1268
01:10:14,688 --> 01:10:16,995
Oh, wait, don’t do
that. No. Uh, uh...

1269
01:10:17,169 --> 01:10:18,388
Actually, don’t do that.

1270
01:10:18,562 --> 01:10:19,911
Uh, hey, hey! Your brother...

1271
01:10:20,085 --> 01:10:21,739
Your brother told
me something...

1272
01:10:21,913 --> 01:10:24,698
before he died. He said, uh...

1273
01:10:24,872 --> 01:10:27,048
He said, um...

1274
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:30,356
"Tell my brother I’m sorry."

1275
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:32,402
[Nate breathing shakily]

1276
01:10:32,576 --> 01:10:33,620
"I’m sorry...

1277
01:10:34,926 --> 01:10:38,930
for that thing that
happened when we were kids."

1278
01:10:40,584 --> 01:10:42,760
And... [breathes heavily]

1279
01:10:43,978 --> 01:10:46,372
...he said, "Tell him...

1280
01:10:46,546 --> 01:10:50,071
Tell him that Mom and Dad
always loved you the most."

1281
01:10:53,771 --> 01:10:54,772
Bullshit.

1282
01:10:56,687 --> 01:10:58,254
We never met our dad.

1283
01:10:58,428 --> 01:11:00,647
Okay, I think maybe he
meant it metaphorically.

1284
01:11:00,821 --> 01:11:03,084
Wait, no! Please, please,
please, please don’t!

1285
01:11:03,824 --> 01:11:04,824
[Andre grunts]

1286
01:11:05,913 --> 01:11:07,393
Roscoe?

1287
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:09,221
No, it’s fucking Daft Punk.

1288
01:11:10,309 --> 01:11:12,877
[breathes heavily]
Of course it’s me.

1289
01:11:13,051 --> 01:11:14,095
[sighs]

1290
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,098
Thank God. I was...

1291
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:21,059
Huh. What do you mean, "huh"?

1292
01:11:21,233 --> 01:11:23,975
Uh... No, I mean,
um... it’s just, uh...

1293
01:11:24,149 --> 01:11:25,716
Didn’t you say...

1294
01:11:26,456 --> 01:11:27,892
that you were six-foot-five

1295
01:11:28,066 --> 01:11:29,981
and that you looked
like Jason Momoa?

1296
01:11:30,155 --> 01:11:32,070
I said I kind of look
like Jason Momoa.

1297
01:11:32,244 --> 01:11:33,463
Right.

1298
01:11:34,986 --> 01:11:36,944
He’s just a very
specific-looking man.

1299
01:11:37,118 --> 01:11:39,512
How about you just say, "Thank
you for saving my life"?

1300
01:11:39,686 --> 01:11:42,036
You’re totally right.
Absolutely. Sorry.

1301
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:44,169
[Nate chuckles]

1302
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:47,259
Oh, hey. [chuckles] Thank you.

1303
01:11:48,216 --> 01:11:49,261
Okay.

1304
01:11:50,262 --> 01:11:51,394
Okay, that’s enough.

1305
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:53,178
[both sigh]

1306
01:11:53,352 --> 01:11:54,672
Look, go do whatever
you got to do

1307
01:11:54,788 --> 01:11:56,268
and please stay alive.

1308
01:11:56,442 --> 01:11:57,965
I need you to be physically able

1309
01:11:58,139 --> 01:11:59,419
to explain all this to the cops.

1310
01:11:59,489 --> 01:12:01,969
Okay... I will stay
alive, I promise.

1311
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:06,626
You’re gonna have to
do better than that.

1312
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:07,975
Oh!

1313
01:12:08,149 --> 01:12:09,629
[Andre grunting]
[Nate shouting] Whoa!

1314
01:12:09,716 --> 01:12:11,762
Roscoe, get something!
Right! Oh, shit. Oh.

1315
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,767
[panting]

1316
01:12:16,941 --> 01:12:18,812
[Andre, Nate grunting]

1317
01:12:22,642 --> 01:12:24,252
[Andre] You
motherfuckers. Heads up!

1318
01:12:24,427 --> 01:12:25,428
[grunts, chuckles]

1319
01:12:35,438 --> 01:12:36,613
Oh, shit! Sorry.

1320
01:12:36,787 --> 01:12:38,571
It’s fine. Just
get something else.

1321
01:12:38,745 --> 01:12:39,790
[Nate grunts]

1322
01:12:39,964 --> 01:12:42,140
[screams] Fucker! [grunts]

1323
01:12:43,054 --> 01:12:44,142
[Nate yelps] [Andre grunts]

1324
01:12:44,316 --> 01:12:45,796
[both grunting]

1325
01:12:46,666 --> 01:12:47,667
You bunch of...

1326
01:12:47,841 --> 01:12:50,061
Aw, shit, man! [coughing]

1327
01:12:50,235 --> 01:12:51,845
Bear mace. Yeah, more, more!

1328
01:12:52,672 --> 01:12:54,718
[grunting]

1329
01:12:54,892 --> 01:12:56,154
Yeah, more.

1330
01:12:56,328 --> 01:12:57,982
Yeah, do you like
this? [chuckles]

1331
01:12:58,156 --> 01:12:59,331
Yeah, that’s right, bi...

1332
01:12:59,505 --> 01:13:01,202
Oh, goddamn it!

1333
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,769
[grunts] I’m gonna kill you!

1334
01:13:02,943 --> 01:13:04,292
Whoa! [Andre grunts]

1335
01:13:05,076 --> 01:13:06,599
[both grunting]

1336
01:13:18,829 --> 01:13:21,092
I’m gonna fucking rip
your fucking head off!

1337
01:13:21,266 --> 01:13:24,225
Just... die! [Nate
grunts, chokes]

1338
01:13:27,533 --> 01:13:29,622
[Nate grunts, strains]

1339
01:13:34,279 --> 01:13:36,934
[Andre gurgling]
[Nate panting]

1340
01:13:45,595 --> 01:13:46,987
Ah, okay.

1341
01:13:48,467 --> 01:13:50,556
[Roscoe groaning]

1342
01:13:53,124 --> 01:13:55,561
Good thinking with the mace.

1343
01:13:55,735 --> 01:13:57,215
[Roscoe] Yeah. [Nate pants]

1344
01:14:01,001 --> 01:14:02,002
Jesus!

1345
01:14:02,176 --> 01:14:05,005
Hell of a way to go.Uh-huh.

1346
01:14:05,919 --> 01:14:07,660
[watch beeping] [Nate groans]

1347
01:14:09,923 --> 01:14:12,143
[beeping stops] What’d
you set a timer for?

1348
01:14:12,317 --> 01:14:14,537
Um, it was for your...

1349
01:14:15,363 --> 01:14:17,496
for your ETA or whatever.

1350
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:21,805
I actually should pee, though.

1351
01:14:21,979 --> 01:14:23,110
Yeah.

1352
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:24,982
Wait, what?

1353
01:14:28,812 --> 01:14:31,162
Who the fuck are
these guys, anyway?

1354
01:14:31,771 --> 01:14:32,946
No idea.

1355
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,687
Huge Home Alonefans, apparently.

1356
01:14:40,824 --> 01:14:42,260
Hey, um...

1357
01:14:44,001 --> 01:14:46,133
thanks again for coming.

1358
01:14:46,307 --> 01:14:50,137
Yeah, well... [inhales deeply]
...what are friends for, right?

1359
01:14:52,357 --> 01:14:54,707
Yeah, man. That being said...

1360
01:14:54,881 --> 01:14:56,796
I will testify against
you if need be.

1361
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:59,233
Yeah, no, no
worries. I assumed.

1362
01:14:59,407 --> 01:15:01,497
[police sirens
wailing] [Roscoe gasps]

1363
01:15:02,323 --> 01:15:03,542
Oh, shit. It’s the cops.

1364
01:15:03,716 --> 01:15:05,109
Well, great.

1365
01:15:05,283 --> 01:15:06,963
Tell them everything.
Let them go save her.

1366
01:15:07,111 --> 01:15:08,610
No, no, no. They’re
not gonna listen to me.

1367
01:15:08,634 --> 01:15:10,375
They think I’m in on
this. [Roscoe sighs]

1368
01:15:10,549 --> 01:15:12,725
No, if I go out there, they’ll
bring me to the station.

1369
01:15:12,899 --> 01:15:14,921
And by the time I can convince
anybody to go after Sherry,

1370
01:15:14,945 --> 01:15:15,945
she’ll be dead.

1371
01:15:16,033 --> 01:15:17,034
[Roscoe sighs]

1372
01:15:18,165 --> 01:15:19,166
Wait a minute.

1373
01:15:20,037 --> 01:15:21,560
I think I have an idea.

1374
01:15:21,734 --> 01:15:23,016
Your Harley... it’s still
parked out front, yeah?

1375
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,084
Yeah.

1376
01:15:24,868 --> 01:15:25,869
Sort of.

1377
01:15:26,913 --> 01:15:28,175
What do you mean "sort of"?

1378
01:15:32,963 --> 01:15:34,442
[Mincy on megaphone]
Nathan Caine!

1379
01:15:34,617 --> 01:15:37,402
I need you to come out the
house with your hands up.

1380
01:15:39,404 --> 01:15:41,667
Look, don’t make this harder
than it has to be, okay?

1381
01:15:41,841 --> 01:15:43,930
This whole town’s going to shit

1382
01:15:44,104 --> 01:15:46,585
’cause the Chargers and
the Clippers betrayed us.

1383
01:15:46,759 --> 01:15:48,761
Really? Now?

1384
01:15:48,935 --> 01:15:50,676
Seriously. Broke
our heart for what?

1385
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:52,722
To be second fiddle to
the Rams and the Lakers?

1386
01:15:52,896 --> 01:15:54,593
Freeze! Freeze!

1387
01:15:54,767 --> 01:15:56,247
[engine starts, revs] Hey!

1388
01:15:56,421 --> 01:15:59,163
Freeze! Freeze! Hey,
stop! Stop! Shit.

1389
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:07,432
[sirens wailing]
[tires squeal]

1390
01:16:12,176 --> 01:16:13,481
[Mincy] Wait, what is he doing?

1391
01:16:13,656 --> 01:16:15,353
[detective] I don’t know.

1392
01:16:15,527 --> 01:16:17,181
[sirens stop] [tires screech]

1393
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:19,009
[Mincy] Hands!

1394
01:16:19,183 --> 01:16:21,054
Let me see your hands! Hands!

1395
01:16:27,017 --> 01:16:28,192
Shit.

1396
01:16:28,366 --> 01:16:29,585
Who the hell is this guy?

1397
01:16:29,759 --> 01:16:31,021
Ha, ha, ha!

1398
01:16:31,195 --> 01:16:32,979
You’ve been deceived,
for I am not Nate!

1399
01:16:33,153 --> 01:16:34,633
Don’t care. [grunting]

1400
01:16:36,243 --> 01:16:39,725
[breathing heavily] But
who you are is somebody...

1401
01:16:39,899 --> 01:16:42,380
who’s about to go to
jail. No, no, wait, wait!

1402
01:16:42,554 --> 01:16:44,835
I can help you! I can help
you! I know where Nate’s going.

1403
01:16:44,861 --> 01:16:46,471
Yeah? Start talking
then. Okay, okay,

1404
01:16:46,645 --> 01:16:48,710
but could we have a no-kicking
policy from this point on?

1405
01:16:48,734 --> 01:16:50,518
Where is he?

1406
01:17:03,401 --> 01:17:05,359
[Simon] All right,
come on! Time to go!

1407
01:17:10,582 --> 01:17:12,802
Where is your jumpsuit?
I’m not doing this, Simon.

1408
01:17:14,238 --> 01:17:15,718
Not doing what?

1409
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:18,024
It’s already done.

1410
01:17:19,722 --> 01:17:21,245
Can’t do it. [Simon sighs]

1411
01:17:21,811 --> 01:17:22,942
Oh, fuck off.

1412
01:17:25,118 --> 01:17:28,426
Since when did you grow a
conscience anyway? [chuckles]

1413
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,168
I mean, what about all
the other jobs we’ve done?

1414
01:17:31,342 --> 01:17:32,865
We’ve killed
people before. No.

1415
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:35,738
No. You’ve killed people
before, Simon. You.

1416
01:17:35,912 --> 01:17:37,391
Not me. I’m not like you.

1417
01:17:40,438 --> 01:17:41,961
[Simon] The thing is...

1418
01:17:42,135 --> 01:17:44,355
you’re not a better
person than I am.

1419
01:17:45,269 --> 01:17:46,574
Not even a little bit.

1420
01:17:46,749 --> 01:17:48,359
’Cause you won’t
admit what you are.

1421
01:17:49,882 --> 01:17:54,191
You think all this fake remorse
is gonna save your soul? Hm?

1422
01:17:56,149 --> 01:17:57,324
It’s bullshit...

1423
01:17:57,498 --> 01:17:58,935
Simon.

1424
01:17:59,805 --> 01:18:01,546
...and you know it.

1425
01:18:04,331 --> 01:18:05,550
Drop the gun!

1426
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:07,639
Oh, my God. Nate.

1427
01:18:07,813 --> 01:18:09,293
I’m not gonna ask you again.

1428
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:11,817
Okay.

1429
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:20,696
You okay, Sherry?

1430
01:18:21,479 --> 01:18:22,523
[breathes shakily]

1431
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:24,350
Um...

1432
01:18:24,438 --> 01:18:25,918
I’m sorry,

1433
01:18:26,092 --> 01:18:27,441
who the fuck are you?

1434
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:30,357
I’m the guy that
killed your friends.

1435
01:18:30,531 --> 01:18:31,968
[breathes shakily]

1436
01:18:32,142 --> 01:18:33,597
So if you don’t want
to wind up like them,

1437
01:18:33,621 --> 01:18:35,449
I suggest you let her go,

1438
01:18:35,623 --> 01:18:37,060
and you get the
hell out of here.

1439
01:18:39,149 --> 01:18:41,673
Oh, my God.

1440
01:18:42,805 --> 01:18:45,938
Oh, my fucking God.

1441
01:18:46,852 --> 01:18:49,072
[Simon laughs] Simon, don’t.

1442
01:18:52,162 --> 01:18:55,165
You’re the guy from
the bank, right?

1443
01:18:57,123 --> 01:18:58,124
[Simon laughs]

1444
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:01,040
Okay.

1445
01:19:01,214 --> 01:19:03,814
This is legitimately the funniest
thing that’s ever happened to me.

1446
01:19:05,001 --> 01:19:08,352
You’ve been tailing us
to try to save... Sherry.

1447
01:19:09,353 --> 01:19:11,224
Is that right? [chuckles]

1448
01:19:12,051 --> 01:19:13,270
Uh...

1449
01:19:13,444 --> 01:19:15,707
I hate to break it
to you, bud, but...

1450
01:19:18,188 --> 01:19:19,885
she’s my fucking sister.

1451
01:19:25,021 --> 01:19:27,588
She played you, man. Yeah.

1452
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:30,026
[Simon laughing]

1453
01:19:31,114 --> 01:19:32,593
[breathes shakily]

1454
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,771
[Simon] You thought that
she had feelings for you.

1455
01:19:35,945 --> 01:19:37,947
Stop, don’t. Nate, I’m...

1456
01:19:39,339 --> 01:19:40,558
I’m so sorry, okay?

1457
01:19:40,732 --> 01:19:43,343
I never meant for
you to... to...

1458
01:19:43,517 --> 01:19:45,157
Look, everything that
happened between us,

1459
01:19:45,215 --> 01:19:46,869
I meant it, okay? It
was real, I swear.

1460
01:19:47,043 --> 01:19:48,883
Oh, what a load of
horseshit! [Sherry stammers]

1461
01:19:49,001 --> 01:19:50,655
[Simon] Look, man,

1462
01:19:50,829 --> 01:19:53,005
you’re pointing the gun at
the wrong bank robber, dude.

1463
01:19:53,963 --> 01:19:55,965
You should be shooting her.

1464
01:19:57,488 --> 01:19:58,881
So, now listen.

1465
01:20:01,274 --> 01:20:03,711
Why don’t you just get
out of here, man. Okay?

1466
01:20:03,886 --> 01:20:06,540
What are you doing?
[Nate breathing heavily]

1467
01:20:06,714 --> 01:20:08,804
Get yourself to the urgent care,

1468
01:20:08,978 --> 01:20:11,110
and just forget all about this.

1469
01:20:11,284 --> 01:20:12,284
[Sherry] Simon, stop it.

1470
01:20:12,416 --> 01:20:13,678
Get over it.

1471
01:20:13,852 --> 01:20:15,201
[Simon, Nate grunting]

1472
01:20:39,747 --> 01:20:40,792
[Simon grunts]

1473
01:20:44,709 --> 01:20:48,104
[Simon pants,
chuckles] [Nate coughs]

1474
01:20:48,278 --> 01:20:50,062
I’ll give it to you, bank boy.

1475
01:20:50,715 --> 01:20:52,108
You can take a punch.

1476
01:20:52,978 --> 01:20:54,588
[Simon sighs] [Nate coughs]

1477
01:20:55,241 --> 01:20:56,677
[Simon grunts]

1478
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:58,723
Let’s see how you do...
[Nate breathes heavily]

1479
01:20:58,897 --> 01:21:00,943
...under a little pressure.

1480
01:21:01,117 --> 01:21:02,509
Perfect.

1481
01:21:02,683 --> 01:21:03,771
[both breathe heavily]

1482
01:21:03,946 --> 01:21:05,599
[mechanism whirring]

1483
01:21:09,255 --> 01:21:10,822
[Sherry] Simon, stop it!

1484
01:21:11,388 --> 01:21:12,737
[laughs]

1485
01:21:12,911 --> 01:21:14,511
[Sherry] It’s not
fucking funny. Stop it!

1486
01:21:14,782 --> 01:21:15,827
[Simon laughs]

1487
01:21:17,481 --> 01:21:18,830
Stop! [Simon shouts]

1488
01:21:19,004 --> 01:21:20,005
[breathes heavily]

1489
01:21:20,179 --> 01:21:21,354
[both grunting]

1490
01:21:21,528 --> 01:21:22,573
Stop!

1491
01:21:22,747 --> 01:21:24,314
[both breathing heavily]

1492
01:21:24,488 --> 01:21:26,205
What the hell you doing?
What are you doing?

1493
01:21:26,229 --> 01:21:27,336
Are you just gonna
crush his head?

1494
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,884
Well, he started it!

1495
01:21:29,058 --> 01:21:31,277
[breathing heavily]

1496
01:21:31,451 --> 01:21:32,670
Just go.

1497
01:21:32,844 --> 01:21:34,444
Honestly, just go!
Take the money and go!

1498
01:21:34,498 --> 01:21:35,847
I’m gonna stay with him.

1499
01:21:36,021 --> 01:21:38,023
[scoffs] You’re gonna
stay with that guy?

1500
01:21:38,197 --> 01:21:39,416
Yeah.

1501
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:40,852
[Simon] Sherry.

1502
01:21:42,506 --> 01:21:43,550
[chuckles] Come on!

1503
01:21:46,075 --> 01:21:48,033
I don’t even know you anymore.

1504
01:21:52,168 --> 01:21:53,169
Fine.

1505
01:21:53,778 --> 01:21:54,778
Hmm.

1506
01:21:54,866 --> 01:21:57,260
[breathing heavily]

1507
01:21:57,434 --> 01:22:00,002
[breathing shakily]

1508
01:22:03,353 --> 01:22:05,442
You won’t do it. Yeah?

1509
01:22:05,616 --> 01:22:06,660
You sure?

1510
01:22:07,444 --> 01:22:08,445
Mm-hmm.

1511
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:16,192
You know what? You’re right.

1512
01:22:17,193 --> 01:22:18,890
You don’t know me anymore.

1513
01:22:20,674 --> 01:22:21,719
[gunshot]

1514
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,156
[breathing heavily]

1515
01:22:27,116 --> 01:22:28,813
[Sherry breathing shakily]

1516
01:22:28,987 --> 01:22:30,902
Got him! Moving in.

1517
01:22:33,426 --> 01:22:35,037
[Mincy] Hands! Hands up!

1518
01:22:35,689 --> 01:22:36,995
Get them on your head.

1519
01:22:42,827 --> 01:22:44,611
[detective] This one’s
cooked. Help this guy.

1520
01:22:44,785 --> 01:22:46,309
[mechanism whirring]

1521
01:22:46,918 --> 01:22:47,919
[grunts]

1522
01:22:49,181 --> 01:22:51,618
Damn, Vespa guy was right.
He’s pretty beat up.

1523
01:22:51,792 --> 01:22:54,970
Yeah, well, good thing
we’re here to save his ass.

1524
01:22:57,102 --> 01:22:59,191
You’re lucky that you
got such a good friend.

1525
01:22:59,365 --> 01:23:00,976
Little too chatty
for me, though.

1526
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:04,457
[chuckles]

1527
01:23:17,166 --> 01:23:18,167
[phone buzzes]

1528
01:23:20,299 --> 01:23:21,953
[Mincy sighs]

1529
01:23:22,127 --> 01:23:24,434
Backup will be here in five.
They’re still stretched thin.

1530
01:23:24,608 --> 01:23:26,436
Does that mean I
can punch out now?

1531
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:28,650
Wanda’s gonna start It’s a
Wonderful Life without me.

1532
01:23:28,786 --> 01:23:30,786
Yeah, we’ll just get the
elves to do your paperwork.

1533
01:23:30,918 --> 01:23:32,548
Mm-hmm. Wouldn’t that
be amazing if we had...

1534
01:23:32,572 --> 01:23:33,791
[gunshot]

1535
01:23:51,374 --> 01:23:52,418

[grunts]

1539
01:24:21,969 --> 01:24:23,623
Hey, hey.

1540
01:24:23,797 --> 01:24:25,930
Show me where you’re
hurt. [Mincy groans]

1541
01:24:26,104 --> 01:24:29,064
[Sherry panting]
[Mincy groaning]

1542
01:24:29,238 --> 01:24:30,282
You’re gonna be okay.

1543
01:24:30,456 --> 01:24:31,936
You just have to
get to a hospital.

1544
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:33,764
I’m gonna take your
car and go after them.

1545
01:24:33,938 --> 01:24:35,809
Like hell! I’m not
giving you my keys.

1546
01:24:37,724 --> 01:24:39,378
Sorry.

1547
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,684
Don’t worry... [gun cocks]

1548
01:24:40,858 --> 01:24:41,989
...I’m gonna make sure...

1549
01:24:46,777 --> 01:24:48,126
You’re really gonna shoot me?

1550
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,780
I should, asshole.

1551
01:24:51,216 --> 01:24:53,392
But I won’t. You’re
taking me with you.

1552
01:24:57,222 --> 01:24:58,222
Okay.

1553
01:24:58,832 --> 01:24:59,877
[Mincy grunts]

1554
01:25:04,621 --> 01:25:06,057
[Roscoe gasping]

1555
01:25:07,624 --> 01:25:10,844
Uh, hey, hi. Uh, could someone
please tell me what’s going on?

1556
01:25:11,018 --> 01:25:13,456
Go, go, go! We’re gonna
lose him! Yeah, don’t worry.

1557
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:15,371
I know where he’s going.

1558
01:25:15,545 --> 01:25:16,850
Where who’s going?

1559
01:25:17,024 --> 01:25:18,176
Oh, we’re on a high-speed
chase right now?

1560
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,201
[tires squeal]

1561
01:25:21,899 --> 01:25:22,943
[sirens wailing]

1562
01:25:27,557 --> 01:25:28,557
[groans] Fuck!

1563
01:25:28,688 --> 01:25:30,473

[Simon groans]

1566
01:25:41,527 --> 01:25:43,094
Oh, shit.

1567
01:25:49,753 --> 01:25:51,774
At this speed, you won’t be
able to make any adjustments,

1568
01:25:51,798 --> 01:25:53,036
and I don’t know
how you drive...

1569
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:54,714
[exclaims] School
bus! [tires squeal]

1570
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,065

[tires squealing]

1574
01:26:14,473 --> 01:26:15,605
What the fuck?

1575
01:26:16,649 --> 01:26:18,085
You again?

1576
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:21,001
Oh, Jesus Christ. [laughs]

1577
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:25,397

Stroller! [pedestrian] Yo!

1582
01:26:43,894 --> 01:26:46,592
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1583
01:26:48,028 --> 01:26:49,943
Jesus! Where’d you learn
to drive like this?

1584
01:26:50,117 --> 01:26:51,641
I used to boost cars.

1585
01:26:54,165 --> 01:26:55,688
What? I don’t anymore!

1586
01:26:55,862 --> 01:26:57,124
[grunting]

1587
01:27:01,868 --> 01:27:03,696
[Simon] Oh, I might be dying,

1588
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:05,394
but I’m gonna kill you first.

1589
01:27:07,178 --> 01:27:09,049
[grunting, strains]

[Simon laughs] [Nate
breathes heavily]

1596
01:27:32,464 --> 01:27:35,032
Oh. You fucking loser.

1597
01:27:35,946 --> 01:27:36,990
[Simon laughs]

1598
01:27:39,428 --> 01:27:41,168
So where’s this son
of a bitch going?

1599
01:27:41,343 --> 01:27:42,692
He’s headed to Pier 7.

1600
01:27:43,736 --> 01:27:45,651
What for? There’s
a boat waiting.

1601
01:27:45,825 --> 01:27:46,957
It was gonna take us south.

1602
01:27:47,131 --> 01:27:49,176
[screams] Taxi! I
can see, thank you!

1603

Hey, slow down! Stop! Stop!

[security guard yells]

01:28:06,237 --> 01:28:07,412
[tires screech]

1607
01:28:10,328 --> 01:28:11,697
[Simon] You want to
know something funny?

1608
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:13,940
If you’d have just
stayed in that bank,

1609
01:28:15,115 --> 01:28:17,248
Sherry would be right
here sitting next to me.

1610
01:28:20,338 --> 01:28:22,688
She’d be just fine. [laughing]

1611
01:28:23,472 --> 01:28:24,821
But now?

1612
01:28:25,561 --> 01:28:26,779
Now...

1613
01:28:26,953 --> 01:28:28,564
I’m gonna hunt her ass down.

1614
01:28:29,434 --> 01:28:31,001
I promise you that.

1615
01:28:32,394 --> 01:28:33,395
Yeah, well...

1616
01:28:35,484 --> 01:28:37,181
if you do find Sherry...

1617
01:28:39,488 --> 01:28:41,117
I want you to tell her
something for me, okay?

1618
01:28:41,141 --> 01:28:42,578
Oh, God.

1619
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:44,710
[laughs]

1620
01:28:44,884 --> 01:28:47,017
You are one sorry
son of a bitch.

1621
01:28:47,191 --> 01:28:49,367
You know that? [laughing]

1622
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:51,369
[electronic whining]
[Simon laughing]

1623
01:28:51,543 --> 01:28:53,545
Yeah. I know, right?

1624
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:55,808
It’s kind of my thing.

1625
01:28:56,853 --> 01:28:58,942
Listen, I want
you to tell her...

1626
01:28:59,595 --> 01:29:01,292
[whirring]

1627
01:29:01,466 --> 01:29:03,786
...that even though we didn’t
spend a lot of time together,

1628
01:29:04,730 --> 01:29:07,559
that I always felt like we...

1629
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,519
could’ve gone... [mumbles]

1630
01:29:11,563 --> 01:29:12,564
[Simon] What?

1631
01:29:14,697 --> 01:29:16,612
What’d you feel
like? [machine beeps]

1632
01:29:16,786 --> 01:29:18,657
What was that?

1633
01:29:18,831 --> 01:29:21,573
I can’t fucking hear you.
You’re mumbling. Speak up!

1634
01:29:21,747 --> 01:29:23,880
Oh, sorry. I’ll try
to be a little more...

1635
01:29:24,054 --> 01:29:25,054
clear!

1636
01:29:25,185 --> 01:29:26,491

[Simon laughs]

1650
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:11,727
I like that you’re making
me earn it, bank boy,

1651
01:31:11,901 --> 01:31:13,468
but we got to wrap this up.

1652

[tires screech]

1653
01:31:16,427 --> 01:31:17,646
Let’s go. [groans]

1654
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:19,778
What?

1655
01:31:19,952 --> 01:31:20,953
Fuck, I can’t.

1656
01:31:21,127 --> 01:31:22,477
I can’t.

1657
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,524
I’m sorry, I have
to go. Wait, wait.

1658
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:32,225
God, I hope I live
to regret this.

1659
01:31:33,879 --> 01:31:34,880
Take it.

1660
01:31:35,968 --> 01:31:38,580
That motherfucker
shot my partner.

1661
01:31:41,365 --> 01:31:42,497
Don’t miss.

1662
01:31:48,546 --> 01:31:50,417
And you, out! Oh, okay.

1663
01:31:51,897 --> 01:31:52,897
Get her to a hospital.

1664
01:31:52,985 --> 01:31:54,465
Sure. Yeah. Go.

1665
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:58,600
Oh! God, that’s a
lot of blood. Huh.

1666
01:31:58,774 --> 01:32:00,906
At least it’s not a stick
shift, am I right? [chuckles]

1667
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:02,473
Sorry. Bleeding
to death. Right.

01:33:16,808 --> 01:33:18,088
Looks like I finally found a way

1687
01:33:18,244 --> 01:33:19,637
to make you feel something, huh?

I’m so sorry,
Nate. I’m so sorry.

I’m here. I’m right here.

1716

I’m not going
anywhere, I promise.

There he is.

1726
01:35:49,569 --> 01:35:51,484
How you feeling, bud?

1727
01:35:51,658 --> 01:35:53,051
What happened?

1728
01:35:53,225 --> 01:35:56,533
Oof. Well, you’ve had
some major blood loss.

1729
01:35:56,707 --> 01:35:58,578
Oh. And a heart attack.

1730
01:35:58,753 --> 01:35:59,971
And a brain hemorrhage.

1731
01:36:01,016 --> 01:36:02,234
And third-degree burns.

1732
01:36:02,408 --> 01:36:04,410
And a lot of broken bones.

1733
01:36:04,584 --> 01:36:05,716
But you’re okay now!

1734
01:36:05,890 --> 01:36:07,674
[laughs] It’s a
Christmas miracle.

1735
01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:10,199
It’s Christmas?

1736
01:36:10,373 --> 01:36:11,766
It’s actually January 11th.

1737
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:13,637
You’ve been in a
medically induced coma.

1738
01:36:13,811 --> 01:36:16,292
But still... [chuckling]
...you’re alive!

1739
01:36:19,512 --> 01:36:22,385
Wait. Sherry. Is
she... is she okay?

1740
01:36:22,559 --> 01:36:24,213
Don’t worry. Sherry’s fine.

1741
01:36:24,822 --> 01:36:25,823
She’s okay.

1742
01:36:26,911 --> 01:36:27,911
Yeesh.

1743
01:36:28,043 --> 01:36:29,914
Oh. We meet again. Hey.

1744
01:36:30,088 --> 01:36:32,047
Hey! Look who’s up.

1745
01:36:32,221 --> 01:36:33,265
[Nate] Yep.

1746
01:36:33,439 --> 01:36:35,485
You look... Um...

1747
01:36:36,921 --> 01:36:37,921
brave.

1748
01:36:38,009 --> 01:36:39,445
I’m glad you’re up

1749
01:36:39,619 --> 01:36:41,534
because I just came
from the courthouse.

1750
01:36:41,708 --> 01:36:44,189
You’re looking at some
pretty serious charges here.

1751
01:36:44,363 --> 01:36:45,887
Manslaughter,
breaking and entering,

1752
01:36:46,061 --> 01:36:47,061
grand theft auto.

1753
01:36:47,149 --> 01:36:48,498
Yeah, those...

1754
01:36:49,586 --> 01:36:50,586
Those sound really bad.

1755
01:36:50,674 --> 01:36:51,849
Yeah, they are.

1756
01:36:52,023 --> 01:36:52,850
There’s enough
here to lock you up

1757
01:36:53,024 --> 01:36:54,064
until you’re twice my age.

1758
01:36:54,112 --> 01:36:55,200
Uh-huh.

1759
01:36:55,374 --> 01:36:57,072
But you did save a cop’s life.

1760
01:36:57,246 --> 01:37:00,640
And you also had some pretty
persuasive character witnesses.

1761
01:37:02,468 --> 01:37:04,949
Also, you’re a white guy
who works for a bank, so...

1762
01:37:05,123 --> 01:37:06,429
the judge took it easy on you.

1763
01:37:06,603 --> 01:37:08,561
Six months house arrest.

1764
01:37:08,735 --> 01:37:10,999
Five years probation.

1765
01:37:11,173 --> 01:37:13,454
Get a lawyer to look at that,
but it’s a pretty good deal.

1766
01:37:15,003 --> 01:37:16,004
Oh. [chuckles]

1767
01:37:16,178 --> 01:37:18,267
Almost forgot the best part.

1768
01:37:20,573 --> 01:37:22,488
This is from Grace.

1769
01:37:24,447 --> 01:37:25,448
My daughter.

1770
01:37:31,454 --> 01:37:32,672
Take care, Nate.

1771
01:37:34,457 --> 01:37:35,632
Thank you, Detective.

1772
01:37:35,806 --> 01:37:37,155
Detective.

1773
01:37:46,643 --> 01:37:48,645
You’re look... Are you
looking at the hand?

1774
01:37:48,819 --> 01:37:51,300
Oh, the hand? Oh, you mean
your burnt-up, crisped-up hand?

1775
01:37:51,474 --> 01:37:52,867
Yeah. Yeah.

1776
01:37:53,041 --> 01:37:54,869
I mean, it’s... it’s
jarring, for sure.

1777
01:37:55,043 --> 01:37:56,218
Is it the worst part?

1778
01:37:56,392 --> 01:37:57,717
I just think they
shouldn’t have to

1779
01:37:57,741 --> 01:37:59,874
dress it up all sexy,
like in fishnets.

1780
01:38:00,048 --> 01:38:01,484
[Nate] It’s a skin graft.

1781
01:38:01,658 --> 01:38:04,095
Look, I would get
a glove... Okay.

1782
01:38:04,269 --> 01:38:05,488
...personally. Yeah.

01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:09,448
Prepare for pain.

1785
01:38:09,622 --> 01:38:11,731
[Roscoe laughs] This guy must
not know who he’s dealing with.

1786
01:38:11,755 --> 01:38:13,409
Okay, cast toxic cloud.

1787
01:38:13,583 --> 01:38:15,463
I’m equipping the blackstone
armor. I’m going in.

1788
01:38:15,541 --> 01:38:17,084
[Roscoe] Oh, hey, you’re
coming on Saturday, right?

1789
01:38:17,108 --> 01:38:18,188
It’s a big birthday for me.

1790
01:38:18,283 --> 01:38:20,024
Yeah, man. Wait, it’s not...

1791
01:38:20,198 --> 01:38:21,634
it’s not at a biker bar, is it?

1792
01:38:21,808 --> 01:38:23,810
[Roscoe] Aw, fuck
you. [laughs]

1793
01:38:23,985 --> 01:38:26,074
Yeah, man, of course
I’m gonna be there.

1794
01:38:26,248 --> 01:38:27,553
[watch beeping]

1795
01:38:28,772 --> 01:38:30,513
Oh. Oh, shit!

1796
01:38:30,687 --> 01:38:32,447
Dude, just hold it for
a couple more minutes.

1797
01:38:32,515 --> 01:38:34,517
This guy’s almost dead.
No, dude, it’s not that.

1798
01:38:34,691 --> 01:38:36,519
I actually have to get
ready for that dinner.

1799
01:38:36,693 --> 01:38:39,217
[Roscoe] Wow. You’re
ditching me to go on a date.

1800
01:38:39,391 --> 01:38:41,480
I know, I know. It’s
very cute and adorable,

1801
01:38:41,654 --> 01:38:44,222
and I will make this up to you
later. Goodbye. Wait, wait, wait...

1802
01:38:47,878 --> 01:38:49,532
[Nate] Hey, uh...

1803
01:38:49,706 --> 01:38:52,622
I can’t believe it’s been a
year since our first date.

1804
01:38:53,623 --> 01:38:54,754
I am...

1805
01:38:54,929 --> 01:38:57,148
so happy I tried the pie.

1806
01:38:58,410 --> 01:38:59,411
Me too.

1807
01:39:00,369 --> 01:39:01,761
And, hey, you even
wore your tie.

1808
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:03,850
Yeah. You noticed.
Yeah. [laughs]

1809
01:39:04,025 --> 01:39:05,722
It took the dry cleaners a while

1810
01:39:05,896 --> 01:39:08,812
to get the blood stains out, but,
um... you know, they managed.

1811
01:39:08,986 --> 01:39:09,987
They did a good job.

1812
01:39:10,161 --> 01:39:11,510
Oh, wait, um...

1813
01:39:11,684 --> 01:39:12,990
Sorry, I almost forgot.

1814
01:39:17,386 --> 01:39:18,386
[Sherry gasps]

1815
01:39:18,474 --> 01:39:19,997
Oh, my God.

1816
01:39:21,868 --> 01:39:23,914
You finally figured
out the ending.

1817
01:39:24,088 --> 01:39:27,918
Felt kind of weird to have the
knight rescuing the damsel.

1818
01:39:28,092 --> 01:39:30,965
So I had them, you know,
kind of saving each other.

1819
01:39:32,227 --> 01:39:33,227
It’s perfect.

1820
01:39:33,358 --> 01:39:34,358
[chuckles]

1821
01:39:34,446 --> 01:39:35,708
[person] Hey!

1822
01:39:35,882 --> 01:39:37,188
Button that shirt up!

1823
01:39:37,362 --> 01:39:39,016
This ain’t no
conjugal visit, man.

1824
01:39:39,190 --> 01:39:41,801
Oh, sorry. No, this isn’t like
a sex thing. This is, uh...

1825
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:44,239
[prison guard] Uh-huh?
Okay, yep. Got it.

1826
01:39:44,413 --> 01:39:46,458
And I know that’s not an
open flame I’m seeing.

1827
01:39:46,632 --> 01:39:47,633
Nope. It’s not.

1828
01:39:49,026 --> 01:39:51,159
[coughs] Sorry.

1829
01:39:51,333 --> 01:39:52,508
Don’t play with me.

1830
01:39:52,682 --> 01:39:53,746
I’m not trying to
play with you, sir.

1831
01:39:53,770 --> 01:39:54,770
Just shh.

1832
01:39:54,901 --> 01:39:56,077
Is he new?

1833
01:39:56,251 --> 01:39:57,295
Uh, no. He’s intense.

1834
01:39:57,469 --> 01:39:58,818
Yeah. He’s really intense.

1835
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:00,361
Yeah, they’re strict
here. It’s jail.

1836
01:40:00,385 --> 01:40:01,841
[prison guard 2]
Inmate 241, time’s up.

1837
01:40:01,865 --> 01:40:04,389
That’s a tight 15
minutes, huh? Yeah.

1838
01:40:04,563 --> 01:40:07,784
At least we only have to put up
with it for another eight months.

1839
01:40:07,958 --> 01:40:10,787
Yeah, seven months, 19
days, but who’s counting?

1840
01:40:10,961 --> 01:40:12,310
[Sherry chuckles]

1841
01:40:12,484 --> 01:40:14,027
[prison guard] Don’t
make me come over there!

1842
01:40:14,051 --> 01:40:15,096
[both laugh]

1843
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:16,290
You’re gonna get me in trouble.

1844
01:40:16,314 --> 01:40:17,359
[Nate] I’m so sorry.

1845
01:40:17,533 --> 01:40:18,708
[whispering] He’s so intense.

1846
01:40:18,882 --> 01:40:20,449
I know. I got to go. Okay.

1847
01:40:24,453 --> 01:40:26,716
I’ll, uh, see you soon...

1848
01:40:27,456 --> 01:40:28,457
Novocaine.

1849
01:40:29,501 --> 01:40:31,416
["Power Lines" playing]

1850
01:40:49,956 --> 01:40:51,523
[chuckling]

1851
01:40:54,439 --> 01:40:57,138
